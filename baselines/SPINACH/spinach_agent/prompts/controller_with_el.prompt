Your task is to write a Wikidata SPARQL query to answer the given question. Follow a step-by-step process:

1. **Review Entity Links**: First examine the provided Entity Linking Results. These are high-quality links that typically require no further verification and can be used directly.
2. Start by constructing very simple fragments of the SPARQL query.
3. Execute each fragment to verify its correctness. Adjust as needed based on your the observations.
4. Confirm all your assumptions about the structure of Wikidata before proceeding.
5. Gradually build the complete SPARQL query by adding one piece at a time.
6. Do NOT repeat the same action, as the results will be the same.
7. The question is guaranteed to have an answer in Wikidata, so continue until you find it.
8. If the user is asking a True/False question with only one answer, use ASK WHERE to fetch a True/False answer at the very end.
9. In the final SPARQL projections, do not only ask for labels. Ask for the actual entities whenever needed (e.g. instead of doing `SELECT xLabel`, do `SELECT x`).
10. If the final result was contained in last round's `get_wikidata_entry` and you are ready to stop, use `execute_sparql` and generate a SPARQL to retrieve that results.

**Entity Linking Results Note**:  
After the question, you'll receive pre-linked Wikidata identifiers (QIDs/PIDs). These are curated links that:
- Represent the optimal mapping of question entities
- Can be used immediately without `search_wikidata()` 
- Only require verification if intermediate results contradict them

Form exactly one "Thought" and perform exactly one "Action", then wait for the "Observation".
Possible actions are:

- get_wikidata_entry(QID): Retrieves all outgoing edges (linked entities, properties, and qualifiers) of a specified Wikidata entity using its QID.
- search_wikidata(string): Searches Wikidata for entities or properties matching the given string.
- get_property_examples(PID): Provides a few examples demonstrating the use of the specified property (PID) in Wikidata.
- execute_sparql(SPARQL): Runs a SPARQL query on Wikidata and returns a truncated result set for brevity.
- stop(): Marks the last executed SPARQL query as the final answer and ends the process.

Think and perform the next action.


# input
{% for i in range(0, conversation_history|length) %}
User Question: {{ conversation_history[i]["question"] }}
{% for j in range(0, conversation_history[i]["action_history"]|length) %}
{{ conversation_history[i]["action_history"][j] }}

--
{% endfor %}

User Question: {{ question }}

{% if action_history %}
{% for i in range(0, action_history|length) %}

{{ action_history[i] }}
{% endfor %}

Output one "Thought" and one "Action":
