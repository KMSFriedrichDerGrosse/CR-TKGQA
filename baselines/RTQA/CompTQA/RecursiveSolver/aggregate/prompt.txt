You are given a question and multiple candidate answers from sources A, B, and C. Follow these strict rules to choose the best answer: If only sources A and B are available, prefer B's answer unless it is "Unknown" or "Error", in which case choose A. If all three sources A, B, and C are available, prefer C's answer unless it is "Unknown" or "Error", then fall back to B, and if B is also invalid, fall back to A. Return only the final answer in this format:
So the answer is: [<best answer>]
